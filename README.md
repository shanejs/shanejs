### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here's a little about me....

I started programming in Basic on a Commodore 64 my generous cousin bought for me when I was 8. I would get computer magazines and type in their code line by line and usually would have an error.

When I got a bit older I began to think programming wasn't for me. But I was comparing myself to older and more experienced people. I needed to compare myself against myself to see my progress. For example, I couldn't understand loops. But when I finally did I started to gain some confidence and began to love programming.

I turned that love of programming to into a great career right around the time the web started to gain traction, in the mid-90s. 

Meanwhile, years later, if you've bought a car in the last 15+ years in Canada I may have helped, as I lead development of AutoTrader.ca and a bunch of other classified sites and back-end dealer systems. I still code for fun and have had some successful side projects which helped me learn new things.

Just remember, coding is just a skill like any other skill. If you like to learn then you can learn coding. It doesn't take a special brain or to be gifted at math or something. Just like anything else, it takes some hard work and learning!
